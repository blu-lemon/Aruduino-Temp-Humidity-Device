# Arduino Temperature and Humidity Sensor Project

## Overview

This project is an Arduino-based temperature and humidity sensor using a DHT sensor and an I2C LCD for display. The project includes the necessary libraries, schematic files, and an Arduino sketch.

## Contents

The repository contains the following files:

- `Temp_Humidity_Sketch.ino` - The main Arduino sketch for the project.
- `MY_DHT.cpp` - The source file for the DHT sensor library.
- `MY_DHT.h` - The header file for the DHT sensor library.
- `MY_I2C_LCD.cpp` - The source file for the I2C LCD library.
- `MY_I2C_LCD.h` - The header file for the I2C LCD library.
- `Schematic.fzz` - The Fritzing schematic file for the project.
- `Schematic.jpg` - The image version of the schematic.

## Requirements

- Arduino board
- DHT11 or DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
- I2C LCD display
- Red, green and blue LEDs
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Libraries

The following libraries are included in this repository:

- **MY_DHT** : Custom library for reading data from the DHT sensor.
- **MY_I2C_LCD** : Custom library for controlling the I2C LCD display.

## Schematic

Below is the schematic for wiring the components:



You can also find the Fritzing schematic file (`Schematic.fzz`) in the repository for more detailed information.
